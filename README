This is a project designed to facilitate bug interchange between various bug
trackers. The bug interchange format is designed to make it easy to transfer
bugs between different bug trackers.

This project also includes a number of converters to convert bugs from various
bug trackers into the portable bug interchange format.

The primary bug tracker for interchange has a static snapshot available at
